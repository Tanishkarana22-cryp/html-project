        <h1>The best movies according to Tanishka</h1>
        <h2>My top three movies of all time</h2>
        <hr></hr>
        <h3>Bhool bhulaiyaa</h3>
        <p>  An NRI and his wife decide to stay in his ancestral home, 
            paying no heed to the warnings about ghosts. Soon, inexplicable 
            occurrences cause him to call a psychiatrist to help solve the mystery.</p>
        <h3>Three idiots</h3>
        <p>Throughout the story, Rancho is telling his friends that don't chase success. But achieve excellence and success
             will come to you themselves. But, unfortunately, we only want success and don't focus on excellence 
            because it demands hard work, commitment, and passion</p>
        <h3>Jab we met</h3>
        <p>One of the best lessons Jab We Met gave us was that one should never kill the inner child in them, 
            just like Geet. </p>
